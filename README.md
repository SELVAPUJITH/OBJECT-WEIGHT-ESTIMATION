🪶 Object Weight Estimation from Image Using YOLOv8 & MiDaS
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on estimating the weight of objects from 2D images using a combination of YOLOv8 for object detection and MiDaS for depth estimation. 
The system integrates shape-based volume calculation with machine learning models to predict approximate object weights. 
The goal is to bridge the gap between image-based detection and real-world physical measurements.
🚀 Key Features
✅ Detects and segments objects in an image using YOLOv8
✅ Estimates depth information using MiDaS
✅ Calculates object dimensions and approximates volume
✅ Converts estimated volume into weight predictions (kg)
✅ Works with real-world images captured by a camera
✅ Extensible for multiple object categories
